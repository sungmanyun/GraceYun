  The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web,
  is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators
  (URLs, such as https://www.example.com/), which may be interlinked by hypertext,
  and are accessible over the Internet.
  [1] The resources of the WWW may be accessed by users by a software application called
